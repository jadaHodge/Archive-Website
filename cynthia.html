                                    In 2012, Cynthia joined an 18+ competitive dance team where her training truly began. 
                                    
                                    <br><br>Through this team, Cynthia pushed herself to embody all the new styles being thrown 
                                    at her in an attempt to be clean on stage. And while Cynthia loved this, she did not 
                                    realize that learning all these new styles were hindering her from exploring her 
                                    own- not because she was not trying to. In fact, her team encouraged her explore her own style, but she didn’t actually know how or what that meant. She HATED freestyling. 
                                    Drawn to the structured styles that were crowd pleasing and appealing to the eye, she,
                                    too, would try to create with pieces like this in mind- not realizing that 
                                    she was truly just creating for others and not herself. 
                                    
                                    <br><br>Cynthia stopped competing in 2015. In summer of 2016, she was invited into 
                                    Archive where she was allowed the space and time to find herself in her movement. 
                                    For the first time in her dance training, she was being told not to try to look like 
                                    the choreographer, but instead, figure out how SHE interpreted the movement. She started 
                                    actually enjoying freestyling and picking it up on her own time as a means to explore who 
                                    she is, both in and out of being a dancer. She began applying the principles of mindful 
                                    movement from yoga into her dancing. 
                                    
                                    <br><br>At the beginning of 2019, Cynthia choreographed her first mindful choreography to 
                                    “Silence” by Marshmellow where she explored applying a part of her story to movement. 
                                    Cynthia continues to explore mindful choreography and learning what her movement is 
                                    teaching her about herself.
