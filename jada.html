                                        Jada Hodge is a mover motivated by emotional connections. She allows 
                                        her body to be controlled by the way she feels in a given moment in time,
                                        allowing emotion to flow through every movement. 
                                        <br><br>She began her dance journey at the age of 17 in Stockton, California 
                                        with competitive dance team, Rhythm Inc. Her dance journey was put on 
                                        hold to focus more on her studies in computer science. 
                                        <br><br>Fortunately this pause didn't last long as she was soon drawn back
                                        to the dance community when she began to make deeper connections with 
                                        other movers. Her style of dance leans towards small intricate 
                                        emotionally-controlled movements.
                                        <br><br>She currently works at Starbucks in Pleasant Hill, California. 
                                        While working as a barista, she continues to pursue her Bachelor's Degree 
                                        in computer science at Arizona State University, where she hopes to 
                                        pursue a Master's Degree shortly after.
                                        <br><br>Jada is currently a dancer with Archive Dance Collective, 
                                        as well as a company member of Cypher Dance Company. She aims to 
                                        live freely-without any limitatioins and/or expectations.
